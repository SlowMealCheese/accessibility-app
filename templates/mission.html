    <h1 class="text-center">Our mission</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        People with disabilities often have difficulty finding places that are accessible -
        despite many efforts, an inability to determine whether stores and restaurants
        are accessible for them increases the quality of life for those with disabilities. This
        hack is a proof-of-concept of a larger system in which those with disabilities and 
        allies of the disabled can post and receive information about accomodations at specific businesses.
